No Real-time Prices

This version of the application does not fetch or display real-time cryptocurrency prices, focusing solely on the visual presentation of cryptocurrency names. It's designed for users who prefer a less dynamic, purely aesthetic terminal experience.
Customizing the Cryptocurrency List

To customize the list of cryptocurrencies displayed:

    Edit the cryptos_config.json file.
    Add or remove entries under the "cryptos" key, specifying the "name" for each cryptocurrency.
    Save the changes and rerun the application to see the updated list.
	
---------
Log File:
---------

The application generates a log file (matrix_crypto.log) to store runtime information, errors, and other log messages. The log is rotated every 10 days to prevent excessive file size.

------------------------
Exiting the Application:
------------------------

TO EXIT THE APPLICATION, PRESS CTRL+C AT ANY TIME.

----------------------
Setup and Start script
----------------------

When you run the setup script (run_linux.sh for Unix-like systems or run_windows.bat for Windows), it automatically creates and activates a Python virtual environment in your project directory. 

The script will install all necessary packages listed in requirements.txt into this environment, making it easy to manage project-specific dependencies and maintain a clean development setup. 

For subsequent uses, you can activate the virtual environment manually with source venv/bin/activate (Unix-like systems) or .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) to run the project or additional Python commands.
