Matrix Crypto Display
=================================

------------
Description:
------------
This application displays real-time cryptocurrency prices in a matrix-style animation within the terminal. It fetches current prices from the CoinGecko API and presents them in a visually appealing, continuously scrolling format. Api updates every 90 seconds


Windows and Linux Terminal using Python 3.6+
-----------
Quick start
-----------

Windows
run_windows.bat

Linux/MacOS
chmod +x run_linux.sh
./run_linux.sh

if you have trouble running then run  sed -i 's/\r$//' ./run_linux.sh
and try again  ./run_linux.sh

----------
Manual
----------
run pip install -r requirements.txt 
 or on Linux just run pip install request
 or on windows run pip install windows-curses requests

---------
Usage
---------

python matrix_crypto.py

-----------
How to Use:
-----------

1. Use the prefilled crypto_list.json or modify and add your own tickers
(optional) You can run any of the .py files to get current list of Solana or Ethereum top 20 to populate the .json config
which is to get token id's and names for prices. Only really need to run once in awhile if what a fresh list. I would remove stable coins like USDC and USDT

python crypto_list.py = gets top 20 overall cryptos by marketcap (default list of cryptos)

python solana_crypto_list.py = gets top 20 solana tokens by marketcap

python ethereum_crypto_list.py = gets top 20 ethereum tokens by marketcap

2. Start the application by running: python matrix_crypto.py or if needed python3 matrix_crypto.py

3. Optional command-line arguments:  python matrix_crypto.py --help
   - --speed [integer]: Sets the speed of the falling text, higher is slower. Default is 300.
   - --color [color name]: Sets the color of the falling text (e.g., green, red, blue). Default is green.
   - --bold: Display text in bold.
   - --solana   crypto ecosystem list.json, i.e solana or eth
   example: python matrix_crypto.py --color white --bold --eth

---------
Log File:
---------

The application generates a log file (matrix_crypto.log) to store runtime information, errors, and other log messages. The log is rotated every 10 days to prevent excessive file size.

------------------------
Exiting the Application:
------------------------

TO EXIT THE APPLICATION, PRESS CTRL+C AT ANY TIME.

----------------------
Setup and Start script
----------------------

When you run the setup script (run_linux.sh for Unix-like systems or run_windows.bat for Windows), it automatically creates and activates a Python virtual environment in your project directory. 

The script will install all necessary packages listed in requirements.txt into this environment, making it easy to manage project-specific dependencies and maintain a clean development setup. 

For subsequent uses, you can activate the virtual environment manually with source venv/bin/activate (Unix-like systems) or .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) to run the project or additional Python commands.
